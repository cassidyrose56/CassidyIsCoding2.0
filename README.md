**Personal Website built with Svelte, TypeScript, and Tailwind.css, with animations made with Adobe Illustrator and GSAP.**

When my new portfolio is published and ready to go, you can visit it [here!](https://www.cassidyiscoding.com/) If you'd like, you can visit my old portfolio now via that link - you'll get to see a snapshot of where I was in my coding journey about a year ago and when my new one is published, you can check out how much I've grown in the past year!
